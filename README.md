## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add nerves_system_rpi3 to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:nerves_system_rpi3, "~> 0.11.0"}]
        end

  2. Ensure nerves_system_rpi3 is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:nerves_system_rpi3]]
        end

## Built-in WiFi Firmware

WiFi modules almost always require proprietary firmware to be loaded for them to work. The
Linux kernel handles this and firmware blobs are maintained in the
`linux-firmware` project. The firmware for the built-in WiFi module on the RPi3
hasn't made it to the `linux-firmware` project nor Buildroot, so it is included
here in a `rootfs-additions` overlay directory. The original firmware files came from
https://github.com/RPi-Distro/firmware-nonfree/blob/master/brcm80211/brcm.
