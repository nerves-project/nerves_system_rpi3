# Mark firmware valid for the Raspberry Pi 3
#
# To use:
#   1. Run `fwup -c -f fwup-mark-valid.conf -o mark_valid.fw` and copy
#      mark_valid.fw to the device. This is done automatically as part of the Nerves
#      system build process. The file is stored in `/usr/share/fwup/mark_valid.fw`.
#   2. On the device, run `fwup -t mark_valid mark_valid.fw -d $NERVES_FW_DEVPATH`.
#
# It is critical that this is kept in sync with the main fwup.conf.

# All of these can be overriden using environment variables of the same name.
#
#  Run 'fwup -m' to query values in a .fw file.
#  Use 'fw_printenv' to query values on the target.
#
# These are used by Nerves libraries to introspect.
