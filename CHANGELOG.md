# Changelog

## v1.14.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2020.11.2, GCC 10.2 and OTP 23.2.4.

When migrating custom systems based on this one, please be aware of the
following important changes:

* There's a new `getrandom` syscall that is made early in BEAM startup. This has
  the potential to block the BEAM before Nerves can start `rngd` to provide
  entropy. We have not seen this issue here, but have updated `erlinit.config`
  for the time being as a precaution.
* The GCC 10.2.0 toolchain has a different name that calls out "nerves" as the
  vendor and the naming is now more consistent with other toolchain providers.
* Experimental support for tooling that requires more information about the
  target has been added. The initial support focuses on zigler.

If you're upgrading from a release before v1.13.3, please see the release notes
for the versions below as well.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.14.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.14.4)
  * [Buildroot 2020.11.2](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-January/302574.html)

  * [Nerves toolchains 1.4.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/toolchains/releases/tag/v1.4.1)

## v1.13.3

This is a bug fix release and contains no major changes.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.13.7](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.13.7)
  * [Erlang/OTP 23.1.5](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.1.5.README)

## v1.13.2

This release includes a patch release update to
[Buildroot 2020.08.2](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2020-November/296830.html).

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.13.5](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.13.5)
  * [erlinit 1.9.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/erlinit/releases/tag/v1.9.0)

* Improvements
  * Switched source for built-in WiFi module firmware. This pulls in newer
    firmware versions that were found to fix issues on the Raspberry Pi 4. It
    may improve built-in WiFi on other Raspberry Pis.

## v1.13.1

The main change in this release is to bump the Linux kernel to 5.4. This follows
the kernel update in the Raspberry Pi OS.

If you have based a custom system off of this one, please inspect the
`nerves_defconfig` for WiFi firmware changes. WiFi firmware is no longer being
pulled from the `rpi-wifi-firmware` since that package is out of date.

Additionally, the upstream Raspberry Pi kernel changed the
`pi3-miniuart-bt.dtbo` overlay's name to `miniuart-bt.dtbo`. The easy fix is to
do a global search for `pi3-miniuart-bt` and replace it with `miniuart-bt`.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.13.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.13.4)
  * [Erlang/OTP 23.1.4](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.1.4.README)
  * [boardid 1.10.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/boardid/releases/tag/v1.10.0)

* Improvements
  * Enabled reproducible builds in Buildroot to remove some timestamp and build
    path differences in firmware images. This helps delta firmware updates.
  * The memory cgroup controller is no longer enabled by default. This was an
    upstream change. As a result, the memory cgroup directory is no longer
    mounted.

## v1.13.0

This release updates to [Buildroot
2020.08](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2020-September/290797.html) and OTP 23.1.1.

* Updated dependencies

  * Added support for updating the root filesystem using firmware patches.
    See the [firmware patch docs](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/experimental-features.html#content) for more information.

## v1.12.2

This release updates to [Buildroot
2020.05.1](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2020-July/287824.html)
and OTP 23.0.3 which are both bug fix releases.

* Updated dependencies

  * [nerves_heart v0.3.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_heart/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

* New features
  * The `/data` directory now exists for storing application-specific data. It
    is currently a symlink to `/root`. Using `/data` will eventually be
    encouraged over `/root` even though currently there is no advantage. This
    change makes it possible to start migrating paths in applications and
    libraries.

* Fixes
  * Fixed old references to the `-Os` compiler flag. All C/C++ code will default
    to using `-O2` now.

## v1.12.1

* Fixes
  * Remove `nerves_system_linter` from hex package. This fixes mix dependency
    errors in projects that reference systems with different
    `nerves_system_linter` dependency specs.

## v1.12.0

This release updates the system to use Buildroot 2020.05 and Erlang/OTP 23.
Please see the respective release notes for updates and deprecations in both

## v1.7.1

* Bug fixes
  * Re-enabled Raspberry Pi Foundation display backlight driver.

* Improvements
  * Bump C compiler options to `-O2` from `-Os`. This provides a small, but
    measurable performance improvement (500ms at boot in a trivial project
    tested on [nerves_system_rpi0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_rpi0)).

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.7.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.7.1)

## v1.7.0

This release bumps the Linux kernel to 4.19.25. This change had an impact on how
the WiFi regulatory database gets loaded into the kernel. Instead of building it
into the kernel as previously done, the kernel loads it on demand. This requires
that all WiFi drivers be built as kernel modules so that the database isn't
loaded before the root filesystem is mounted. If you made a custom system and
see boot errors about not being able to load the regulatory database, this is
the problem.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.7.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.7.0)
  * Linux 4.19.25 with patches from the Raspberry Pi Foundation

  * Enable pstore, an in-memory buffer that can capture logs, kernel
    oops and other information when unexpected reboots. The buffer can be
    recovered on the next boot where it can be inspected.

## v1.6.0

This pulls in a pending patch in Buildroot to update the version of
OpenSSL from 1.0.2 to 1.1.0h. This fixes what appears to be issues with
Erlang using OpenSSL engines. It also enables Erlang crypto algorithms
such as ed25519 that have been added in recent Erlang releases.

  * Linux 4.14.71 with patches from the Raspberry Pi Foundation
  * Erlang 21.0.9

## v1.4.1

* Bug fixes
  * Trim Linux module list to remove warnings on OSX builds. This makes a few
    other changes to the module list to remove some difficult to use modules on
    Nerves projects.

## v1.4.0

This release contains various updates to provisioning variables and data.

**Host requirements**

Building firmware using this system requires `fwup` to be updated on your
host computer to at least `v1.2.5`. The target minimum version requirement
has not changed from `0.15.0`.

**Serial numbers**

Device serial numbers are now set using `NERVES_SERIAL_NUMBER` instead of
`SERIAL_NUMBER`. This is to reduce ambiguity on the source of the serial
by name spacing it along side other Nerves variables. The U-Boot environment
key has also changed from `serial_number` to `nerves_serial_number`. The
erlinit.config has been updated to provide backwards compatibility for setting
the hostname from the serial number by checking for `nerves_serial_number`
and falling back to `serial_number`.

**Custom provisioning**

Provisioning data is applied at the time of calling the `fwup` task `complete`.
The `complete` task is executed when writing the firmware to the target disk.
During this time, `fwup` will include the contents of a provisioning file
located at `${NERVES_SYSTEM}/images/fwup_include/provisioning.conf`. By default,
this file only sets `nerves_serial_number`. You can add additional provisioning
data by overriding the location of this file to include your own by setting
the environment variable `NERVES_PROVISIONING`. If you override this variable
you will be responsible for also setting `nerves_serial_number`.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.4.5](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.4.5)

## v1.3.0

* nerves_system_br v0.13.2
  * OTP 20
  * erlinit 1.1.3
  * fwup 0.15.3

## v0.13.0

* nerves_system_br v0.12.1
  * erlinit 1.1.1
  * fwup 0.15.0

* New features
  * The application data partition is now `ext4`. This greatly improves its
    robustness to corruption. Nerves.Runtime contains code to initialize it on
    first boot.
  * Firmware images now contain metadata that can be queried at runtime (see
    Nerves.Runtime.KV
  * Increased GPU memory to support Pi Camera V2

## v0.12.0

* nerves_system_br v0.10.0
  * Buildroot 2017.02
  * Erlang/OTP 19.3

* New features
  * Upgraded the Linux kernel from 4.4.43 -> 4.4.50. Due to the coupling
    between the Linux kernel and rpi-firmware and possibly rpi-userland, if
    you have a custom system based off this, you should update your Linux
    kernel as well. (see `nerves_defconfig`)

## v0.11.0

* New features
  * Enabled USB_SERIAL and FTDI_SIO support. Needed for connecting with Arduino to the USB ports
  * Support for Nerves 0.5.0

## v0.10.0

* New features
  * Upgraded the Linux kernel to 4.4.43. This also removes the
    call to mkknlimg which is no longer needed.
  * Bump toolchain to use gcc 5.3 (previously using gcc 4.9.3)
* Bug Fixes
  * brcmfmac is being compiled as a module. This means that in order to use wifi you will need to `modprobe brcmfmac`. This addresses an issue where the module would not initialize properly on some boards.

## v0.9.1

* Bug Fixes
* Fixed issues with wifi not starting on some devices

## v0.9.0

This version switches to using the `nerves_package` compiler. This will
consolidate overall deps and compilers.

* Nerves.System.BR v0.8.1
  * Support for distillery
  * Support for nerves_package compiler

## v0.7.0

When upgrading to this version, be sure to review the updates to
nerves_defconfig if you have customized this system.

  * Bug Fixes(nerves-env)
    * Added include paths to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
    * Pass sysroot to LDFLAGS

## v0.5.0

* Nerves.System.BR v0.5.0
  * New features
    * WiFi drivers enabled by default on RPi2 and RPi3
    * Include wireless regulatory database in Linux kernel by default
      on WiFi-enabled platforms. Since kernel/rootfs are read-only and
      coupled together for firmware updates, the normal CRDA/udev approach
      isn't necessary.
    * Upgraded the default BeagleBone Black kernel from 3.8 to 4.4.9. The
      standard BBB device tree overlays are included by default even though the
      upstream kernel patches no longer include them.
    * Change all fwup configurations from two step upgrades to one step
      upgrades. If you used the base fwup.conf files to upgrade, you no
      longer need to finalize the upgrade. If not, there's no change.

## v0.4.1

* Nerves.System.BR v0.4.1
  * Bug fixes
    * syslinux fails to boot when compiled on some gcc 5 systems
    * Fixed regression when booting off eMMC on the BBB
