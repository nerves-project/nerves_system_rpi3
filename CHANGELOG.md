# Changelog

## v1.7.2

* Bux fixes
  * Add TAR option `--no-same-owner` to fix errors when untarring artifacts as
    the root user.
* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.7.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.7.2)

## v1.7.1

* Bug fixes
  * Re-enabled Raspberry Pi Foundation display backlight driver.

* Improvements
  * Bump C compiler options to `-O2` from `-Os`. This provides a small, but
    measurable performance improvement (500ms at boot in a trivial project
    tested on [nerves_system_rpi0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_rpi0)).

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.7.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.7.1)

## v1.7.0

This release bumps the Linux kernel to 4.19.25. This change had an impact on how
the WiFi regulatory database gets loaded into the kernel. Instead of building it
into the kernel as previously done, the kernel loads it on demand. This requires
that all WiFi drivers be built as kernel modules so that the database isn't
loaded before the root filesystem is mounted. If you made a custom system and
see boot errors about not being able to load the regulatory database, this is
the problem.

    recovered on the next boot where it can be inspected.

## v1.6.0

This pulls in a pending patch in Buildroot to update the version of
OpenSSL from 1.0.2 to 1.1.0h. This fixes what appears to be issues with
Erlang using OpenSSL engines. It also enables Erlang crypto algorithms
such as ed25519 that have been added in recent Erlang releases.

* Bug fixes
  * Trim Linux module list to remove warnings on OSX builds. This makes a few
    other changes to the module list to remove some difficult to use modules on
    Nerves projects.

## v1.4.0

This release contains various updates to provisioning variables and data.

**Host requirements**

Building firmware using this system requires `fwup` to be updated on your
host computer to at least `v1.2.5`. The target minimum version requirement
has not changed from `0.15.0`.

**Serial numbers**

Device serial numbers are now set using `NERVES_SERIAL_NUMBER` instead of
`SERIAL_NUMBER`. This is to reduce ambiguity on the source of the serial
by name spacing it along side other Nerves variables. The U-Boot environment
key has also changed from `serial_number` to `nerves_serial_number`. The
erlinit.config has been updated to provide backwards compatibility for setting
the hostname from the serial number by checking for `nerves_serial_number`
and falling back to `serial_number`.

**Custom provisioning**

Provisioning data is applied at the time of calling the `fwup` task `complete`.
The `complete` task is executed when writing the firmware to the target disk.
During this time, `fwup` will include the contents of a provisioning file
located at `${NERVES_SYSTEM}/images/fwup_include/provisioning.conf`. By default,
this file only sets `nerves_serial_number`. You can add additional provisioning
data by overriding the location of this file to include your own by setting
the environment variable `NERVES_PROVISIONING`. If you override this variable
you will be responsible for also setting `nerves_serial_number`.

This release contains updates to Erlang and heart from `nerves_system_br` and
mostly cosmetic changes to this project. The trivial `.fw` files are no longer
created by CI scripts. If you've forked this project and are building systems
using CI, make sure to update your publish scripts.

  indefinitely for the urandom pool to initialize

## v0.16.1

* Updated dependencies
  * nerves_system_br v0.13.7

## v0.16.0

This release contains an updated toolchain with Linux 4.1 Headers.
You will have to clean and compile any c/c++ code in your project and
dependencies. Failure to do so will result in an error when producing firmware.

* nerves_system_br v0.13.5
  * fwup 0.15.4

* Nerves toolchain v0.11.0

## v0.15.0

* nerves_system_br v0.13.3
  * erlinit 1.1.4

* New features
  * Firmware updates verify that they're updating the right target. If the target
    doesn't say that it's an `rpi3` through the firmware metadata, the update
    will fail.
  * Added meta-misc and meta-vcs-identifier to the `fwup.conf` metadata for use
    by users and for the regression test framework
  * Use String.trim instead of String.strip to silence Elixir 1.5 warnings

## v0.14.0

* nerves_system_br v0.13.2
  * OTP 20
  * erlinit 1.1.3
  * fwup 0.15.3

## v0.13.0

* nerves_system_br v0.12.1
  * erlinit 1.1.1
  * fwup 0.15.0

* New features
  * The application data partition is now `ext4`. This greatly improves its
    robustness to corruption. Nerves.Runtime contains code to initialize it on
    first boot.
  * Firmware images now contain metadata that can be queried at runtime (see
    Nerves.Runtime.KV
  * Increased GPU memory to support Pi Camera V2

## v0.12.0

* nerves_system_br v0.10.0
  * Buildroot 2017.02
  * Erlang/OTP 19.3

* New features
  * Upgraded the Linux kernel from 4.4.43 -> 4.4.50. Due to the coupling
    between the Linux kernel and rpi-firmware and possibly rpi-userland, if
    you have a custom system based off this, you should update your Linux
    kernel as well. (see `nerves_defconfig`)

## v0.11.0

* New features
  * Enabled USB_SERIAL and FTDI_SIO support. Needed for connecting with Arduino to the USB ports
  * Support for Nerves 0.5.0

## v0.10.0

* New features

    call to mkknlimg which is no longer needed.
  * Bump toolchain to use gcc 5.3 (previously using gcc 4.9.3)
* Bug Fixes
  * brcmfmac is being compiled as a module. This means that in order to use wifi you will need to `modprobe brcmfmac`. This addresses an issue where the module would not initialize properly on some boards.

## v0.9.1

* Bug Fixes
* Fixed issues with wifi not starting on some devices

## v0.9.0

This version switches to using the `nerves_package` compiler. This will
consolidate overall deps and compilers.

  * New features
    * WiFi drivers enabled by default on RPi2 and RPi3
    * Include wireless regulatory database in Linux kernel by default
      on WiFi-enabled platforms. Since kernel/rootfs are read-only and
      coupled together for firmware updates, the normal CRDA/udev approach
      isn't necessary.
    * Upgraded the default BeagleBone Black kernel from 3.8 to 4.4.9. The
      standard BBB device tree overlays are included by default even though the
      upstream kernel patches no longer include them.
    * Change all fwup configurations from two step upgrades to one step
      upgrades. If you used the base fwup.conf files to upgrade, you no
      longer need to finalize the upgrade. If not, there's no change.
