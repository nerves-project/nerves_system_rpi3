## v0.10.0

  * New features
    * Upgraded the Linux kernel to 4.4.43. This also removes the

    * Bump toolchain to use gcc 5.3 (previously using gcc 4.9.3)
  * Bug Fixes
    * brcmfmac is being compiled as a module. This means that in order to use wifi you will need to `modprobe brcmfmac`. This addresses an issue where the module would not initialize properly on some boards.

    * New features
      * WiFi drivers enabled by default on RPi2 and RPi3
      * Include wireless regulatory database in Linux kernel by default
        on WiFi-enabled platforms. Since kernel/rootfs are read-only and
        coupled together for firmware updates, the normal CRDA/udev approach
        isn't necessary.
      * Upgraded the default BeagleBone Black kernel from 3.8 to 4.4.9. The
        standard BBB device tree overlays are included by default even though the
        upstream kernel patches no longer include them.
      * Change all fwup configurations from two step upgrades to one step
        upgrades. If you used the base fwup.conf files to upgrade, you no
